Cannot insert it :you can find it in the Folder FeedBack-Data

day 30/11/2022 : DQN seem to be not efficient, after many tries, I was not able to improve it. En fact the snake was focus on eating the apple but when it started being long the random and learning part was over so he was not able to understand the recommanded direction (in the beginning this value was useless so the snake haven't improve this part)
